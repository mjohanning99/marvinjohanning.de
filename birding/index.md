This page contains some information about my hobby of birding / birdwatching. You will find some information about my [birding reports](/reports/), the clubs I participate in, [what birds I have seen](/birding/birds_photographed/), what programs I use and more.  

### General information
I mostly go birding in my general area, but I am planning on visiting other locations in order to see birds which do not reside in Bielefeld and the surrounding region. I mostly use my Canon M100 camera with a 55 - 200 mm lens to take and watch the birds, but I am planning on upgrading both my camera and, especially, my lens some time soon. I have also recently begun recording birds' songs and calls and creating spectrograms thereof. 

### Programs I use
I use a variety of programs and website for identifying birds, writing down and sharing my sightings, editing audio recordings and more.
