This page contains some information about my hobby of birding / birdwatching. You will find some information about my [birding reports](/reports/), the clubs I participate in, [what birds I have seen](/birding/birds_photographed/), what programs I use and more.  

### General information
I mostly go birding in my general area, but I am planning on visiting other locations in order to see birds which do not reside in Bielefeld and the surrounding region. I mostly use my Canon M100 camera with a 55 - 200 mm lens to take and watch the birds, but I am planning on upgrading both my camera and, especially, my lens some time soon. I have also recently begun recording birds' songs and calls and creating spectrograms thereof. 

### Programs I use
I use a variety of programs and website for identifying birds, writing down and sharing my sightings, editing audio recordings and more. 

#### Scythebill
The program I use most frequently is [Scythebill](https://www.scythebill.com); it is free and open-source software which you can use to enter your sightings and export them to, for example, eBird or iNaturalist. I have even helped somewhat with the German translation of this program. It has a lot of features and the developer is friendly and replies swiftly to emails when you have problems or ideas on how to improve it. This is, in my opinion, a must-have! You can even import your sightings from eBird or even the Ornitho system prevalent in German-speaking areas of Europe.

#### Raven Lite
Raven Lite is a great program for analysing and improving one's audio recordings of bird songs and calls. Additionally, it allows you to view the spectrogram of a particular audio recording, adjust it to your liking (themes, contrast, etc.) and even export is as an image. I tend to pre-process my audio slightly using Audacity, but I am sure all that processing (mostly applying high- and low-pass filters and removing noise) can be doing quite comfortably in Raven Lite as well if you know how to.
