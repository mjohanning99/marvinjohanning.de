<p>Hello there! My name is Marvin, I am twenty-odd years old and live in Germany. My particular interests revolve around technology and language — and I am the maintainer of a website dedicated to freely distributing information on the Ancient Greek language called <a href="//ancient-greek.net">ancient-greek.net</a> —, especially older ones — this applies to both the technology and language aspect. I have always found the somewhat <i>dated</i> things more interesting; they have more of apersonality than newer things to do me, for some reason. The latter is also why I like studying ancient languages such as Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek. I don’t have any scholarly background, though, and am currently trying to finish my apparenticeship as an <i>IT-Systemelektroniker</i> (IT systems technician) at a company in Bielefeld, Germany.
I am also somewhat of a minimalist and I prefer things that are more minimalist and simply functional, rather than something overly bloated when it has no right to be.</p>

<p>Personally, one of the main things I spend my time on in my free-time is learning more ab
out languages and, at present, I am focussing primarily on Attic / Koine Greek. I know a variety of
scripts and have learnt a large number of languages over the course of my life; I have not, however, learnt enough of these languages to have an actual conversation and thus, the only languages I can
actually <i>speak</i> are German, English and Swedish.</p>

<p>I also enjoy travelling very much, even though I have not visited that many countries or places yet because of lack of money. Besides the language and travelling stuff, I also enjoy trying out new types of coffee, tea, wine, whisky (true whisky is spelt without an “e”!) and beer which is often accompanied by me reading a book or just listening to music (Klaus Schulze, Neuronium, Tangerine Dream, Эдуард Артемьев, 冨田 勲 — you get the picture, a lot of perhaps more ambient electronic music — and just a lot of 70s and 80s in general (I especially enjoy Japanese 70s). I also highly enjoy a lot of classical music — Beethoven and Vivaldi being one of my favourites — and I also think a lot of Vapourwave is rather nice.</p>

<p>I also thoroughly enjoy HF radio and do quite a bit of shortwave, medium wave and longwave DXing in my free-time as well and programming is also a thing I enjoy doing from time to time. The majority of my programming projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mjohanning99">Github</a> page.</p>
