        "excerpt": "A book for learning the basics of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs for people with absolutely no linguistic background; teaches the basics in an accessible manner.\n",
        "content": "\n\nClick here to download a PDF copy\n\nBlurb\nThe language spoken by the Ancient Egyptians is a very mystical language indeed. Spoken by a culture as old to the Romans as they are to us — it seems impossible for us to decipher these mysterious symbols and understand the words uttered by the kings of yore; yet, in this book, you will be learning the very basics of this language using real-world texts and for those wishing to delve even deeper into the culture behind this fascinating language, the two additional chapters on date-keeping and the Westcar Papyrus will provide you with further insight.\n\nInformation about the book\nThis is the first book I have ever published. I started working on it in late 2018 and finally published in in March 2020, shortly after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how to read Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in a way so that even people who are not linguists can pick up the book and know the basics of this writing system in a rather short period of time. I am planning on re-publishing it using my current publisher some time soon so that it can be made available internationally as well.\n\nObtaining your copy\nAt present, there are merely two ways of obtaining your own copy; you can either download the PDF from this website or get the book using its ISBN. The latter may, however, prove difficult. I am planning on re-publishing this book but under a different publisher so that it can be distributed internationally as well.\n",

        "title": "The Apocalypse of John — A Modern Illustrated Translation with Notes and the Original Greek Text",
        "excerpt": "My translation of the Apocalypse (or Revelation) of John written in a modern style and with pictures and paintings following every chapter and the original Greek text.\n",
        "content": "\n\nClick here to download a PDF copy\n\nBlurb\nThe Apocalypse of John is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the World. In this new and modern translation, you will find not only a pleasant-to-read (but still faithful to the original) edition of the Revelation, but also the original Greek text on the opposite page and plenty of notes to help you understand the original scripture.\n\nInformation about the book\nIhave been working on my own translation of the Revelation for quite a while now and decided it was time to finally publish it as a book. It is published and printed by the Books on Demand GmbH in Germany. The initial release consists of an e-book and a dust-jacketed hard-cover, with the latter costing €25.99 and the former being entirely free. A cheaper (probably around €14.99) paperback version will also be released over the course of the next few months.\n\nIt can be bought and ordered at all bookstores in Germany, most bookstores across Europe and on Amazon. People living in the US will — for now, at any rate — have to order the book from Amazon UK. I am working on getting a paperback version released worldwide, so that this problem can be solved.\n\nObtaining your copy\nThere are numerous ways of obtaining your own copy of the book; the most complicated one would be the acquisition of the book’s source code and compiling it yourself. The second, and perhaps easier way, of obtaining a digital copy of the book is to either read it online or to download the original e-book. If you prefer physical media, you can also buy the book directly from your local book store by providing them with the ISBN (978-3-7543-2897-2). The book will be printed on demand and should generally arrive within a week or so.\n",

        "title": "John’s Revelation — A Modern Annotated Translation",
        "excerpt": "My translation of the Revelation of John written in a modern style with a contemporary book design. Ideal for newcomers to the Bible.\n",
        "content": "\n\nClick here to download a PDF copy\n\nBlurb\nThe Revelation of John (or Apocalypse) is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the world. This new and modern translation aims to turn the Revelation into a novel closely following the original scripture. Inline notes and comments ensure that the reader understands the context of a passage all the while clearly marking which parts of the translation are the translator’s comments and suggestions. This way, the book can be read either more fluently or, if so desired, in a more literal translation. It is perfect for those who have yet to start studying the Bible and wish to start by reading the most interesting book the Bible has to offer.\n\nInformation about the book\nAs you are surely aware, I published my first translation — the one which included the original text and illustrations after every chapter — of John’s Revelation (or Apocalypse) in the summer of last year. I had planned on selling it internationally, as my publisher was offering at the time, but was surprised to find out that international distribution was only offered for paperbacks. Additionally, the book’s rather steep price of €25.99 must have surely deterred many people from buying it.\n\nTherefore, it has been my plan to publish a cheaper — and more mass-market — version of my book for some time now; and this has now finally been done. This new English-only edition features a completely overhauled and modern design and a much lower price of only €9.99. I sincerely hope that this will ensure that a larger number of people will be able to afford the book and thus have the chance to read my translation.\n\nThe new design and typesetting has been created to ensure that the book look and feel is more akin to that of a contemporary novel; I have, therefore, also decided to leave out line and verse numbers entirely. I want people to read this translation as if it were just another contemporary novel, albeit one with is, at times, somewhat strangely worded.\n",

    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "This page will provide you with some further insights into who I am and what exactly I do and why. To find out more about one of my interests or hobbies, please click the appropriate link in the menu.\n\nGeneral\nHello there! My name is Marvin, I am 24 years old and live in Germany. My particular interests revolve around technology and language. I am the maintainer of a website dedicated to freely distributing information on the Ancient Greek language called Ancient-Greek.net; I also run a YouTube channel and Twitter account with the same name and for the same purpose. I have always found the somewhat dated things more interesting; they have more of a personality than newer things to do me, for some reason. The latter is also why I like studying ancient languages such as Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek.\n\nI don’t have any scholarly background, though, and am currently working as an IT-Systemelektroniker (IT systems technician) at a company in Bielefeld, Germany. There, I work in customer support, coordinating the deployment of technicians to solve Internet and TV problems, solving customers’ technical issues using remote maintenance of servers and other technical equipment, and I also coordinate the deployment and setup of our new LoRaWAN network.\n\nAdditionally, I am a hobbyist author and have already published various books. I am also somewhat of a minimalist and I prefer things that are more minimalist and simply functional, rather than something overly bloated when it has no right to be.\n\nLanguages\nPersonally, one of the main things I spend my time on in my free-time is learning more about languages and, at present, I am focussing primarily on Attic / Koine Greek. I know a variety of scripts and have learnt a large number of languages over the course of my life; I have not, however, learnt enough of these languages to have an actual conversation and thus, the only languages I can actually speak are German, English and Swedish.\n\nBirding\nI also very much enjoy birding and frequently go outside to take photographs of birds, record their songs and calls and create spectrograms of them and I also write down my sightings in my birding log (usually using an app to record the sightings directly “in the field”). Additionally, I  write birding reports from time to time and am a member of the Nordrhein-Westfälische Ornithologengesellschaft e. V. (North Rhine-Westphalian Ornithological Society) where I try to participate in voluntary bird counting programs (currently, I am part of the AG Wasservögel) and various other activites. I am also a member of the Naturschutzbund Bielefeld.\n\nWriting\nI also thoroughly like writing things, be it birding reports or books. I have written a variety of books and a handful of them have already been published as well. I mostly write translations of Ancient Greek texts (most notably the Greek New Testament) into either English or German. I have also written and published a book on the Ancient Egyptian language and how to learn it as a beginner who has no linguistic background whatsoever. You can find more information about these two books by clicking the “Books” tab in the menu. I also run a website on Ancient Greek (Ancient-Greek.net) where I publish a lot of translations and other information on the language as well.\n\nOther\nI also enjoy travelling very much, even though I have not visited that many countries or places yet because of lack of money. Besides the language and travelling stuff, I also enjoy trying out new types of coffee, tea, wine, whisk(e)y and beer which is often accompanied by my reading a book or just listening to music (Klaus Schulze, Neuronium, Tangerine Dream, Эдуард Артемьев, 冨田 勲 — you get the picture, a lot of perhaps more ambient electronic music — and just a lot of 70s and 80s in general (I especially enjoy Japanese 70s). I also highly enjoy a lot of classical music — Beethoven and Vivaldi being one of my favourites — and I also think a lot of Vapourwave is rather nice.\n\nI also do a bit of programming every now and then. The majority of my programming projects can be found on my GitHub page.\n",

There, you will find my photos (mostly of birds) separated by specices and date.\n\nI also thoroughly enjoy photography. Not only do I love taking photos of birds, I also love photographing landscapes, flowers and a lot of other stuff. My very first DSLR was a Canon EOS 1100D with a kit lens as well as a 300 mm Canon lens (I do not remember the exact specifications). I used that camera from around 2015 up until 2018. I then bought a new camera, a Canon EOS M100, initially only with the kit lens. I soon (2019) added a Canon EF-M 22mm f/2 STM to my equipment and then in 2022 I added a Canon EF-M 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM as I had mostly switched over to bird photography.\n\nI used this setup until Feburary 2023 when I tried out a Lumix DC-FZ82 which I, however, promptly sent back again as it did not really meet my requirements for a decent camera. At the end of March, then, I bought a used Canon EOS 70D as well as a Tamron SP 150-600mm f/5-6.3 Di VC USD G2. My other cameras were sold. I will be adding some nice travel lenses with something around 20 - 300 mm to my collection as well and the obligatory prime lens with a very large aperature will be added soon, too.\n",

    "content": "This page contains some information about my hobby of birding / birdwatching. You will find some information about my birding reports, the clubs I participate in, what birds I have seen, what programs I use and more.\n\nGeneral information\nI mostly go birding in my general area, but I am planning on visiting other locations in order to see birds which do not reside in Bielefeld and the surrounding region. I mostly use my Canon M100 camera with a 55 - 200 mm lens to take and watch the birds, but I am planning on upgrading both my camera and, especially, my lens some time soon. I have also recently begun recording birds’ songs and calls and creating spectrograms thereof.\n\nClubs and activites\n\n  \n  \n\n\nI participate mainly in activites of the North Rhine-Westphalian Ornitholigical Society (Nordrhein-Westfälische Ornithologengesellschaft) of which I am a member. I have asked to participate in the AG Wasservögel and will take part in the Wasservogelzählung (i. e. in the counting of various water birds once every month — depending on region) starting in 2022. This will entail my walking around specificed bodies of water, counting all the relevant bird species and submitting the data electronically via the ornitho.de system. Please look at the following link if you wish to participate yourself: Wasservogelzählung. A membership is not required, but at least rudimentary knowledge of German and a decent water bird identification ability would most likely be advisable.\n\nIn addition to being a member of the above-mentioned club, I am also a member of the NABU (Naturschutzbund) of the city that I currently reside in, namely Bielefeld. I have yet to take part in any activites of that club, but I am planning on attending a few Vogelkundliche Spaziergänge (ornithological walks) and also the photography meet-up some time soon.\n\nPrograms I use\nI use a variety of programs and website for identifying birds, writing down and sharing my sightings, editing audio recordings and more.\n\nScythebill\nThe program I use most frequently is Scythebill; it is free and open-source software which you can use to enter your sightings and export them to, for example, eBird or iNaturalist. I have even helped somewhat with the German translation of this program. It has a lot of features and the developer is friendly and replies swiftly to emails when you have problems or ideas on how to improve it. This is, in my opinion, a must-have! You can even import your sightings from eBird or even the Ornitho system prevalent in German-speaking areas of Europe.\n\nRaven Lite\nRaven Lite is a great program for analysing and improving one’s audio recordings of bird songs and calls. Additionally, it allows you to view the spectrogram of a particular audio recording, adjust it to your liking (themes, contrast, etc.) and even export is as an image. I tend to pre-process my audio slightly using Audacity, but I am sure all that processing (mostly applying high- and low-pass filters and removing noise) can be doing quite comfortably in Raven Lite as well if you know how to.\n\nR (statistical programming language)\nSince I always note which birds I saw at what location, I can use this data to create statistics and maps showing where particular species were seen, how many species were seen at a particular location, how many birds where seen at which location during a birding trip and so forth. In order to better visualise this data, I started learning the R programming language which, unlike many other (so-called general purose) programming languages, has a particular purpose: statistical computing.\n\nThe main advantage of using R over other, more general-purpose programming languages, is the fact that R makes it particularly easy to create visually pleasing statistics and maps and I was, therefore, able to create my first maps and graphs after only a couple of hours of playing around with R in RStudio. I have been refining my scripts ever since and have attempted to make them more aesthetically pleasing. If you wish to take a look at them yourself and perhaps use them for your own projects as well, you’re free to check out the GitHub repository. Beware, however, that the code is still rather messy.\n\nWebsites\nIn addition to programs I use offline on my computer, I also make use of a variety of online tools, especially for entering trip data. This is also required for a lot of the activites of the club mentioned above.\n",
