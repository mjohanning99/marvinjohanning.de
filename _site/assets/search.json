        "content": "\n\nClick here to download a PDF copy\n\nBlurb\nThe language spoken by the Ancient Egyptians is a very mystical language indeed. Spoken by a culture as old to the Romans as they are to us — it seems impossible for us to decipher these mysterious symbols and understand the words uttered by the kings of yore; yet, in this book, you will be learning the very basics of this language using real-world texts and for those wishing to delve even deeper into the culture behind this fascinating language, the two additional chapters on date-keeping and the Westcar Papyrus will provide you with further insight.\n\nInformation about the book\nThis is the first book I have ever published. I started working on it in late 2018 and finally published in in March 2020, shortly after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how to read Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in a way so that even people who are not linguists can pick up the book and know the basics of this writing system in a rather short period of time. I am planning on re-publishing it using my current publisher some time soon so that it can be made available internationally as well.\n\nObtaining your copy\nAt present, there are merely two ways of obtaining your own copy; you can either download the PDF from this website or get the book using its ISBN. The latter may, however, prove difficult. I am planning on re-publishing this book but under a different publisher so that it can be distributed internationally as well.\n",

        "title": "The Apocalypse of John — A Modern Illustrated Translation with Notes and the Original Greek Text",
        "excerpt": "My translation of the Apocalypse (or Revelation) of John written in a modern style and with pictures and paintings following every chapter and the original Greek text.\n",
        "content": "\n\nClick here to download a PDF copy\n\nBlurb\nThe Apocalypse of John is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the World. In this new and modern translation, you will find not only a pleasant-to-read (but still faithful to the original) edition of the Revelation, but also the original Greek text on the opposite page and plenty of notes to help you understand the original scripture.\n\nInformation about the book\nIhave been working on my own translation of the Revelation for quite a while now and decided it was time to finally publish it as a book. It is published and printed by the Books on Demand GmbH in Germany. The initial release consists of an e-book and a dust-jacketed hard-cover, with the latter costing €25.99 and the former being entirely free. A cheaper (probably around €14.99) paperback version will also be released over the course of the next few months.\n\nIt can be bought and ordered at all bookstores in Germany, most bookstores across Europe and on Amazon. People living in the US will — for now, at any rate — have to order the book from Amazon UK. I am working on getting a paperback version released worldwide, so that this problem can be solved.\n\nObtaining your copy\nThere are numerous ways of obtaining your own copy of the book; the most complicated one would be the acquisition of the book’s source code and compiling it yourself. The second, and perhaps easier way, of obtaining a digital copy of the book is to either read it online or to download the original e-book. If you prefer physical media, you can also buy the book directly from your local book store by providing them with the ISBN (978-3-7543-2897-2). The book will be printed on demand and should generally arrive within a week or so.\n",

        "title": "John’s Revelation — A Modern Annotated Translation",
        "excerpt": "My translation of the Revelation of John written in a modern style with a contemporary book design. Ideal for newcomers to the Bible.\n",
        "content": "\n\nClick here to download a PDF copy\n\nBlurb\nThe Revelation of John (or Apocalypse) is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the world. This new and modern translation aims to turn the Revelation into a novel closely following the original scripture. Inline notes and comments ensure that the reader understands the context of a passage all the while clearly marking which parts of the translation are the translator’s comments and suggestions. This way, the book can be read either more fluently or, if so desired, in a more literal translation. It is perfect for those who have yet to start studying the Bible and wish to start by reading the most interesting book the Bible has to offer.\n\nInformation about the book\nAs you are surely aware, I published my first translation — the one which included the original text and illustrations after every chapter — of John’s Revelation (or Apocalypse) in the summer of last year. I had planned on selling it internationally, as my publisher was offering at the time, but was surprised to find out that international distribution was only offered for paperbacks. Additionally, the book’s rather steep price of €25.99 must have surely deterred many people from buying it.\n\nTherefore, it has been my plan to publish a cheaper — and more mass-market — version of my book for some time now; and this has now finally been done. This new English-only edition features a completely overhauled and modern design and a much lower price of only €9.99. I sincerely hope that this will ensure that a larger number of people will be able to afford the book and thus have the chance to read my translation.\n\nThe new design and typesetting has been created to ensure that the book look and feel is more akin to that of a contemporary novel; I have, therefore, also decided to leave out line and verse numbers entirely. I want people to read this translation as if it were just another contemporary novel, albeit one with is, at times, somewhat strangely worded.\n",

    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "This page will provide you with some further insights into who I am and what exactly I do and why. To find out more about one of my interests or hobbies, please click the appropriate link in the menu.\n\nGeneral\nHello there! My name is Marvin, I am 23 years old and live in Germany. My particular interests revolve around technology and language — and I am the maintainer of a website dedicated to freely distributing information on the Ancient Greek language called ancient-greek.net —, especially older ones — this applies to both the technology and language aspect. I have always found the somewhat dated things more interesting; they have more of apersonality than newer things to do me, for some reason. The latter is also why I like studying ancient languages such as Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek. I don’t have any scholarly background, though, and am currently working as an IT-Systemelektroniker (IT systems technician) at a company in Bielefeld, Germany. Additionally, I am an author and have already published various books. I am also somewhat of a minimalist and I prefer things that are more minimalist and simply functional, rather than something overly bloated when it has no right to be.\n\nLanguages\nPersonally, one of the main things I spend my time on in my free-time is learning more about languages and, at present, I am focussing primarily on Attic / Koine Greek. I know a variety of scripts and have learnt a large number of languages over the course of my life; I have not, however, learnt enough of these languages to have an actual conversation and thus, the only languages I can actually speak are German, English and Swedish.\n\nBirding\nI also very much enjoy birding and frequently go outside to take photographs of birds, make audio recordings of them and write them down in my log. Additionally, I  write birding reports from time to time and am a member of the Nordrhein-Westfälische Ornithologengesellschaft e. V. (North Rhine-Westphalian Ornithological Society) where I try to participate in voluntary bird counting programs (currently, I am part of the AG Wasservogelzählung) and various other activites. I am also a member of the Naturschutzbund Bielefeld.\n\nWriting\nI also thoroughly like writing things, be it birding reports or books. I have written a variety of books and published a handful of them have already been published as well. I mostly write translations of Ancient Greek texts (most notably the Greek New Testament) into either English or German. I have also written and published a book on the Ancient Egyptian language and how to learn it as a beginner. You can find more information about these two books by clicking the “Books” tab in the menu. I also run a website on Ancient Greek (Ancient-Greek.net) where I publish a lot of translations and other information on the language as well.\n\nOther\nI also enjoy travelling very much, even though I have not visited that many countries or places yet because of lack of money. Besides the language and travelling stuff, I also enjoy trying out new types of coffee, tea, wine, whisk(e)y and beer which is often accompanied by my reading a book or just listening to music (Klaus Schulze, Neuronium, Tangerine Dream, Эдуард Артемьев, 冨田 勲 — you get the picture, a lot of perhaps more ambient electronic music — and just a lot of 70s and 80s in general (I especially enjoy Japanese 70s). I also highly enjoy a lot of classical music — Beethoven and Vivaldi being one of my favourites — and I also think a lot of Vapourwave is rather nice.\n\nI also do a bit of programming every now and then. The majority of my programming projects can be found on my Github page.\n",
