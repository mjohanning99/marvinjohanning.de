I"n<p>I also thoroughly enjoy photography. Not only do I love taking photos of <a href="/birding/">birds</a>, I also love photographing landscapes, flowers and a lot of other stuff. My very first DSLR was a Canon EOS 1100D with a kit lens as well as a 300 mm Canon lens (I do not remember the exact specifications). I used that camera from around 2015 up until 2018. I then bought a new camera, a Canon EOS M100, initially only with the kit lens. I soon (2019) added a Canon EF-M 22mm f/2 STM to my equipment and then in 2022 I added a Canon EF-M 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM as I had mostly switched over to bird photography.</p>

<p>I used this setup until Feburary 2023 when I tried out a Lumix DC-FZ82 which I, however, promptly sent back again as it did not really meet my requirements for a decent camera. At the end of March, then, I bought a used Canon EOS 70D as well as a  Tamron SP 150-600mm f/5-6.3 Di VC USD G2. My other cameras were sold. I will be adding some nice travel lenses with something around 20 - 300 mm to my collection as well and the obligatory prime lens with a very large aperature will be added soon, too.</p>
