I";<p>I also thoroughly enjoy photography. Not only do I love taking photos of <a href="/birding/">birds</a>, I also love photographing landscapes, flowers and a lot of other stuff. My very first DSLR was a Canon EOS 1100D with a kit as well as a 300 mm Canon lens (I do not remember the exact specifications). I used that camera from around 2015 up until 2018. I then bought a new camera, a Canon EOS M100, initially only with the kit lens. I soon (2019) added a Canon EF-M 22mm f/2 STM to my equipment and then in 2022 I added a Canon EF-M 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM	.</p>
