I"¬<p>This page contains some information about my hobby of birding / birdwatching. You will find some information about my <a href="/reports/">birding reports</a>, the clubs I participate in, what birds I have seen, what programs I use and more.</p>

<h3 id="general-information">General information</h3>
<p>I mostly go birding in my general area, but I am planning on visiting other locations in order to see birds which do not reside in Bielefeld and the surrounding region. I mostly use my Canon M100 camera with a 55 - 200 mm lens to take and watch the birds, but I am planning on upgrading both my camera and, especially, my lens some time soon. I have also recently begun recording birdsâ€™ songs and calls and creating spectrograms thereof.</p>

<h3 id="programs-i-use">Programs I use</h3>
<p>I use a variety of programs and website for identifying birds, writing down and sharing my sightings, editing audio recordings and more.</p>
