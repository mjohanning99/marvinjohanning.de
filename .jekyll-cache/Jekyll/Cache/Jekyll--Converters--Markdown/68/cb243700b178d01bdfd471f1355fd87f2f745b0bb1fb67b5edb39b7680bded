I"‰<p>I also thoroughly enjoy photography. Not only do I love taking photos of <a href="/birding/">birds</a>, I also love photographing landscapes, flowers and a lot of other stuff. I generally use my Canon M100 camera or, at times, my iPhone 13 with ProCamera. The latter is an app that allows you to shoot photos in RAW and, thus, have more control over their final look when editing them.</p>
