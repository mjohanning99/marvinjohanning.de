I also thoroughly enjoy photography. Not only do I love taking photos of [birds](/birding/), I also love photographing landscapes, flowers and a lot of other stuff. I used to mainly use my Canon EOS M100 camera with a 50 - 200 mm lens to capture photos of birds. However, as the rather small focal length did not allow me to capture birds very well, especially if they were further away, I decided to buy a Panasonic DC-FZ82 as an additional camera. It does not have the same image quality — in fact, it is much inferior — but it allows me to get close to the birds as it has a 20 - 1200 mm lens. My boyfriend now uses my M100 to take his own photos of birds. 

I always shoot in RAW and edit my photos in Lightroom afterwards. This tends to give me much better image quality compared to shooting in JPEG.
