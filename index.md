Hello and welcome to my personal website, MarvinJohanning.de. On here, you will be able to find a plethora of information about me and my projects. I have written a number of books, like photography and birding, like learning languages and more. Currently working as an IT systems technician (_IT-Systemelektroniker_) in Bielefeld, Germany. If you would like to learn more about me, visit the [About](/about/) page.  

I am also the administrator of two services, namely [Birds.Town](https://birds.town) and [BirdTu.Be](https://birdtu.be) — A Mastodon and a PeerTube instance for birders, respectively.
