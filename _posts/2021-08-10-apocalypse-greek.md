## Blurb
The Apocalypse of John is one of the most fascinating books of the entire New Testament; it is filled to the brim with colourful and powerful imagery and is as suspenseful as any modern story about the end of the World. In this new and modern translation, you will find not only a pleasant-to-read (but still faithful to the original) edition of the Revelation, but also the original Greek text on the opposite page and plenty of notes to help you understand the original scripture.
